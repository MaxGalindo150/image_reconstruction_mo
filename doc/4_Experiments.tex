This chapter presents the experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. The experiments are divided into three parts. The first part is a comparation of the regularizaded and multi-objective optimization approaches in one dimension. The second part is a comparation of the regularizaded and the hybrid optimization approaches in one dimension. The third part is a comparation of the regularizaded and the hybrid optimization approaches in two dimensions. The results are presented in the form of tables and figures. The tables show the results of the experiments in terms of the number of evaluations, the number of generations, the number of solutions in the Pareto front, and the hypervolume. The figures show the Pareto fronts of the solutions obtained by the algorithms.
