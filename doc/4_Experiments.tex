This section presents the results of the experimentes. Experiments in one dimension are destineted to compere regularized optimization with Tikhonov regularization, multi-objective optimization with NSGA-II and hybrid optimization. Experiments in two dimensions are destineted to compare regularized optimization with Tikhonov regularization and hybrid optimization.

\section{Experiments in one dimension}

To compare the performance of the three optimization methods, we conducted experiments using synthetic data generated from the linear state space model described in Section \ref{sec:lit:two}. The forward model outlined in Section \ref{sec:lit:one} was used to simulate the photoacoustic effect, generating measurements that were subsequently reconstructed using the three optimization methods. The experiments were designed to evaluate the accuracy and stability of the solutions obtained by each method, providing insights into their performance under varying noise levels and sample sizes.
